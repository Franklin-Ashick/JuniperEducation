# Tower House School Website - Multiple Versions

hey there! so this is the tower house school website project and i made a few different versions because why not lol. each one gets better and more fancy so you can pick whatever vibe you're going for.

## whats in here

### index.html (Part 1) - The Original
this is where it all started. pretty clean and simple design with:
- nice navigation that works good
- hero section with the school info
- journey section with those tower icons and curved lines (took forever to get right btw)
- numbers section showing off stats
- footer with all the contact stuff
- mobile responsive so it looks good on phones too

**main files:**
- `index.html` - the main page
- `css/styles.css` - all the styling 
- `js/main.js` - javascript for interactions

### part2.html (Part 2) - The Modern Upgrade  
this one is way more modern and fancy looking. completely redesigned everything:
- purple/blue gradient theme that looks sick
- better animations and hover effects
- card-based layouts everywhere
- modern navigation with glassmorphism (thats the blurry glass effect)
- timeline journey section that looks professional
- interactive tabs for academics section
- way better forms with nice styling
- overall just more polished and contemporary

**main files:**
- `part2.html` - the modern version
- `css/styles2.css` - modern theme styles
- `js/main.js` - same javascript functionality

## how to use

1. just open any of the html files in your browser
2. or if you want to run it properly, use a local server (like live server extension in vscode)
3. all the images should be in the `assets/` folder
4. the css and js files are organized in their respective folders

## features that work

- smooth scrolling navigation
- mobile responsive design (looks good on phones)
- interactive elements and hover effects
- form validation (well, frontend only)
- modern animations and transitions
- back to top button
- mobile menu for smaller screens

## differences between versions

**index.html (part 1):**
- more traditional design
- blue color scheme
- simpler layout
- basic animations
- good for conservative/classic look

**part2.html (part 2):** 
- super modern design
- purple/pink gradients
- advanced animations
- glassmorphism effects
- card-based everything
- way more interactive
- professional premium feel

## tech stuff
- pure html/css/javascript (no frameworks)
- uses css grid and flexbox for layouts
- fontawesome for icons
- google fonts (inter + playfair display for part 2)
- modern css features like backdrop-filter
- responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet

## notes
- the journey section was a pain to get the curved lines right but finally got it working
- part 2 looks way more premium and modern
- all images are optimized but you might want to compress them more for production
- works in all modern browsers (chrome, firefox, safari, edge)

## if you want to customize
- colors are defined as css variables at the top of each css file
- easy to change fonts by updating the google fonts link
- all the content is in the html so you can update text easily
- images just replace them in the assets folder with same names

anyway hope you like it! the second version (part2.html) is definitely my favorite because it looks so much more professional and modern. but the first one is good too if you want something more simple and classic.

let me know if you need any changes or have questions!
